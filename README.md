# P2-OC-ChaletsEtCaviar
Website with WordPress

Create a website for a real estate agency of a mountain resort in WordPress.

This project is the 2nd done as part of my training (« Développeur d’applications-spécialité PHP/Symfony » OC).

## Instructions for this project:

The application is developed with WordPress.

This agency wants to be able to update its website regularly by itself. 
The purpose is to create a website with Wordpress that they can edit and use a theme tailored to their needs.

Needs :
* Design "clear, sleek, breathing the luxury line of the agency". Customize and translate in French the theme so that the agency feels "at home". 
* Create an administrator account for the director of the agency.
* Create an administrator account for the developer if it does not already exist.
* Create publisher accounts for the other 2 employees of the agency.
* Provide the update instructions to the agency.
